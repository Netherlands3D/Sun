 # Sun, Time of Day and Shadows

This package contains the means to add a near-realistic Day/Night cycle to your project. This will allow for 
shadow simulations that reflect the time of day and day in a specific year.

Please note that this package is specific for the Universal Render Pipeline (URP) as the shadow manipulation
modifies your render pipeline to make the shadow length as realistic as possible.

## Installing

This package is provided through OpenUPM, to install it using the CLI you can perform the following:

```bash
$ openupm add eu.netherlands3d.sun
```

or, you have to add `https://package.openupm.com` as a scoped registry with, at least, the following scopes:

- `eu.netherlands3d`

## Usage

> Please note that for this package to work as expected, you need to have the Origin set up from the 
> Coordinates package.

The easiest path is to use the Sun prefab that is included and 

1. Hook up the Directional Light that is representing your sun to the Suntime script. 
2. Hook up your UniversalRenderPipeline to the DynamicShadowDistance script.

After this, the script will automatically alter the Sun's position according to the specified date and time. These  

When using real-world positions, please consult the Coordinates package how to configure the position of 0,0,0 in 
worldspace to match a specific point in the real world.

# Repository Archived

This repository has been **archived** and is no longer maintained independently.

The contents of this package have been merged into the  
**[Netherlands3D Main Repository](https://github.com/Netherlands3D/twin)**  
into the `Packages` folder.

## Current Location

The latest version and future updates of this package will be maintained inside the Netherlands3D main repository as part of an effort to simplify and unify our development workflow.

## Why was this repository archived?

To streamline development and reduce overhead, the Netherlands3D packages are being integrated into the main repository.  
This approach allows for better coordination between packages and features, while we continue to evaluate whether a full monorepo setup (including versioning) is desirable in the future.

## Where to contribute

Please open issues and pull requests in the [Netherlands3D Main Repository](https://github.com/Netherlands3D/twin).

## Publication status

Updates to this package on **OpenUPM** are **suspended until further notice**.  
Future releases will be managed from the main repository once the new development flow has been finalized.

## Historical reference

This repository remains available in read-only mode as a historical record of its standalone development.
